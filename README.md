Computer Science IA project


This is just a small project I am doing for school. You really gonna need just a couple of things.
1. Install Python. Please use the latest version:) You can do that here: https://www.python.org
2. Using the requirements package install Django like this:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Cd into the project until you find manage.py file
5. Type this in :
python manage.py runserver
7. Enjoy.
