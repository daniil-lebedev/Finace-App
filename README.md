Computer Science IA project


This is just a small project I am doing for school. You really gonna need just a couple of things.
1. Install Python. Please use the latest version:) You can do that here: https://www.python.org
2. Using the requirements package install Django like this pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Cd into the project until you find manage.py file
4. Type this in :python manage.py runserver
5. Enjoy.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
